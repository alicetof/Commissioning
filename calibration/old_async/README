# e.g.
./mergerun.sh LHC22m 523142

# if the reconstruction was splitted in subdir (large runs)
./mergerunSub.sh LHC22m 523142
# output also splitted in parts


# once collected calibration can be run locally

./calibOffset.sh 523559
# if run was short (only one input) scripts with "Simple" in the name should be used


# with this config objects are read (but the ones needed from prod ccdb) and loaded in test ccdb
